# Tetris

Tetris recreation w/ Java. 

The game itself is not in a "true" playable state. Major changes that need to be made:
- There is no start menu
- The game breaks when no more blocks can be placed
- Need to allow rotations that slide pieces left/right that would normally cause the pieces to go out of bounds.
- ...More features that I want/need to add

To get the source code running:
- Create a Java project with your favorite IDE
  - Make sure to name packages as needed
- Include the "PressStart2P-Regular.ttf" in the source directory
- Run project normally

Controls:
- Move piece left: Left Arrow Key
- Move piece right: Right Arrow Key
- Move piece down quickly: Down Arrow Key
- Rotate Piece: Spacebar
- Pause Game: Escape
  - Select Option in Pause Menu: Enter
  - Change Selection in Pause Menu: Up/Down Arrow Keys
